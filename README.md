# DES Encryption Exercise

This project contains my implementation work for a DES (Data Encryption Standard) assignment completed in C.

## Overview
I used the provided DES C code to:
- Convert my family name and student ID into binary and then hexadecimal,
- Apply required padding rules (family name to 64 bits, student ID to 56 bits),
- Add missing parity bits for the 56-bit DES key,
- Run the DES program to encrypt my family name using my student ID as the secret key.
